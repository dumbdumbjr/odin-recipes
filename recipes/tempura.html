        <p>
            Tempura is a Japanese dish where seafood or vegetables are lightly battered and deep-fried to create a crispy<br>
            coating. It’s often served with a dipping sauce called tentsuyu. The batter is made from flour, egg, and ice water,<br>
            resulting in a light and airy texture.
