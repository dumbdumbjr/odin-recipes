            Yakitori is a Japanese dish of grilled chicken skewers, seasoned with a soy-based sauce. These succulent skewers<br>
            are often enjoyed as street food or in casual parlors, where they're cooked over a charcoal fire<br>
            until perfectly charred and flavorful. The simplicty of yakitori lies in its focus on quality ingredients and expert<br>
